# PERSONAL FINANCE MANAGER
My program will be a personal tool that I can use to track some financial 
information. I can copy the JSON object that gets returned when I view my 
transaction history on my bank's web site. My project will contain a page where
I can paste the JSON in and have it parse it into my database. I will be adding 
category information to each transaction, so after importing it will redirect to
a page to enter the categories manually.

On another page, budgets can be created, updated and deleted per category.

Finally, monthly summary pages will break spending down into these categories,
and display the information with different types of charts.
